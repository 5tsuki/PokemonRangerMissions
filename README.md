# Pokémon Ranger Missions Editor
Edit Pokémon Ranger 2 and 3 save files to add special events missions

## Info
Currently it only works with static values, custom website with all that dynamic jazz and to not download anything is in WIP

I think you need Node 14, to run it.

Just run `node index.js`

It was made in half an hour, I'm not sure it works 110% to be honest with you.
